# ParamFuzz üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Advanced Multi-threaded URL Parameter Fuzzer

ParamFuzz is a **robust and fast Python-based tool** designed for the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing and bug hunting. It discovers potential GET parameters on a target URL by employing both simple reflection checks and **advanced differential analysis**.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Advanced Differential Analysis:** Compares the baseline response size (in bytes) of the target URL with the fuzzed request. A significant change in size indicates that the server successfully processed the parameter, even if the value wasn't reflected.
* **Multi-threaded Execution:** Utilizes Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to send requests simultaneously, drastically increasing scan speed and efficiency.
* **Reflection Check:** Includes a basic check to catch parameters that echo the input value (`PARAMFUZZVALUE`) back in the response body.
* **CLI Support:** Simple command-line interface using `argparse` for easy use.
